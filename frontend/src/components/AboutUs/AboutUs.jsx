            <h2>Making Someone's Favorite Shirt since 1986!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jim Holodak, and we are ALL U, Inc. We are a family owned and operated company with over 25 years of experience in the screen printing and embroidery business. I got into the shirt business while still attending Siena College in upstate New York. Our initial niche was to service the groups and events on college campuses across the northeast -hence the name ALL U (All Universities). ALL U also means -All You! All you want, all you need...ALL U.</p>
            <p>As our business grew over the years, we have been very fortunate to expand our customer relationships across the country. In addition to our wide variety of custom products, we also create several lines of licensed merchandise. Our partners include properties such as Nyan Cat, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Three Stooges, Albert Einstein, I Love Lucy, Abbott and Costello. In addition to our many entertainment properties, we offer art and lifestyle lines of Mike Made ThisÂ®, Stephen Huneck, Rubes, and several in-house lines. Our customers include many elementary schools, high schools and colleges in the northeast, as well as national retail accounts such as Hot Topic, Delia's, NBC, Universal Studios, Yankee Candle, Kohl's, The Smithsonian Institute, Cracker Barrel.</p>
            <p>My dedicated staff and I are proud to serve our community of customers, and we would love the chance to serve you. Whether you need an order of a dozen shirts or thousands, we would love to make your shirt one of your favorites.</p>
